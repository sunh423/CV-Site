          <h5>My Journey into the Product Management World</h5>

           <p> As someone with an interest in contributing to education, I wanted to create a product that both utilized my skills as a Product Manager and was practical. During my days of tutoring and working with students, I have realized that worksheets that tailored to the students' needs are somewhat hard to come by. In my specific case, since I worked with younger students, I needed worksheets that were interesting and captivating to my students. It's easy to just jot down some math problems for my students to tackle. But what use is it if the students are not engaged in the learning? We've all been students at some point in our lives, and the classes we remember disliking are, undoubtedly, the ones we found the most boring. </p>
            
          <p>Fortunately, learning does not have to be that way. Learning can be made interesting and rewarding. So rather than sitting around and waiting for someone else to make the worksheets that can provide joyful learning for my students, I thought, "Why not do it myself?"</p>

        <h2 id="2">Market Research</h2>

          <p>With any good products, the first step is to research the market before jumping in with the idea. If the market is already saturated with what I am looking for, most likely it would be hard to generate success. Likewise, if the market has little potential competitors, it is important to scout out to see what these competitors are doing right and what kind of audiences we may be trying to capture with our product idea. That is, if, the product we are trying to create even solves a problem that is worth solving. All of this boils down to market research and roadmapping.</p>

          <p>Up at the very top of private educational assets provider, we have the well-known giant: Savvas (formerly known as Pearson). Dread it or love it, when it comes to education resources, most school districts partner up with Savvas. With much of 2020's education system being reliant on digital platforms due to social distancing, Savvas is becoming more attractive as a choice. Savvas comes from an educational curriculum background where they publish textbooks covering the Common Core curriculum used by public schools. Savvas' main competitors are McGrawHill and Cengage. Both are trying to provide a complete package of K-12 materials encased in a digital platform for teachers and students alike. </p>

          <p>For runners up, we have IXL Learning (based in San Mateo, CA) and DreamBox (based in Bellevue, WA). One thing to be noted is that neither of these two companies provide comprehensive textbooks like Savvas. Both IXL Learning and Dreambox specializes in providing adaptive learning on digital platforms. These two companies have been gaining tractions for last few years here in Washington state. Both platforms provide a "gamified" way for students to learn new materials. From my personal experience working with students, they tend to like learning on these platforms as they make learning a lot more fun. This is something to consider later in my product development phase.
          </p>

          <p>When it comes to textbooks and exercises, here's where educators tend to have a little bit more freedom. Certain teachers tend to like some textbooks more than others. Much of this is due to the controversies around Common Core curriculum. Almost all of the teachers and parents I have interviewed with have mentioned that parts of traditional Common Core can be unnecessarily complicated. Luckily, different textbook authors have the liberty of explaining concepts in easier ways. As such, teachers naturally have varied preferences towards the specific textbook materials for their classrooms. A handful of these textbooks are written by teachers, professors and other educators with experiences and credentials. One caveat to these textbooks is that costs can be high either for the schools or families if the class chooses to adopt it. Many underfunded public schools do not have this luxury.</p>

          <h5 id="2.1">Main Competitors</h5>
          <p>At the very end of the list, we have supplementary resources. This is where specific exercises, lesson plans, and worksheets come in handy. Teachers in schools that are underfunded may choose to use whatever textbook resources they are given and then sprinkle in additional supplementary resources to complete the learning experience. Many of these resources are very affodrable (possibly free), and can provide deeper understanding for students in troubled areas. Tutors like myself with little to no funding dig into these resources for hidden gems. Notice how I say "hidden"? As powerful as the Google engine is, most standalone supplementary resources offered by different communities are very scattered. There are of course some sites dedicated to hosting a larger library. For these sites, navigating through the different worksheets can be another challenge.</p>

          <p>Since our primary target audience are shared by the supplementary resources community, I did a more extensive direct and indirect competitor analysis on this <a href="Project Droplets/Market Analysis.xlsx" download>Excel spreadsheet</a>. This spreadsheet contains my notes and research on the 9+ organizations that host supplementary resources. At a workplace, this would be what I present when introducing a new product idea, and what I would continue to track and revise throughout the product's life cycle.</p>

          <h5 id="2.2">First Experience with TeachersPayTeachers</h5>

          <p>In the realm of supplementary resources, one organization takes on a very different approach. TeachersPayTeachers, as stated on their website, is the "world's most popular online marketplace for original educational resources with more than four million resources available for use today." Essentially, TeachersPayTeachers is both a digital marketplace and library with both paid and free resources contributed by educators. Here's where I typically acquire worksheets that fit the criterias I have in mind. Fun, interesting and clearly handmade.</p>

          <p>There's <strong>two reasons</strong> a market like this exists:</p>

          <p>First, unlike the larger corporations, many of the educators that contribute to Teachers Pay Teachers chooses to do so because they are frustrated with the lack of options. Options that students actually want. Many of the today's curriculum designers at education companies have never been teachers themselves, or, are no longer teaching. </p>
       
          <p>Second, it can be very affordable. At most public schools, teachers have to work with the materials and tools provided by the school. The financial expenditures are already dictated by school policies. This can be problematic because there is no one-size-fit-all education solution for different students' learning styles. For these teachers, if they wanted anything else, they would have to acquire it on their own and likely pay out of their own pockets.</p>

          <p>All in all, TeachersPayTeachers is pretty great. Given that this Droplets project of mine is a solo project without many investors, TeachersPayTeachers will be the platform I will be publishing on to minimize resource expenditures. Having a pre-existing known platform and potential patrons (teachers, parents and other tutors) will boost marketing and minimize risks in the scenario where the product flops.</p>

        <h2 id="3">Roadmapping</h2>
          <h5 id="3.1">Hypothesis & Assumptions</h5>
          <p>In my time using TeachersPayTeachers, I found that quality resources are limited in quantity and the bountiful resources simply did not address my problems as a tutor. Younger students tend to have shorter attention span to stay focused on traditional worksheets with just problems. <em><strong>My hypothesis is that a "fun" worksheet is more effective at engaging younger students, and be able to provide the students with the practices needed to expand on their learning.</strong></em> As with any great Product Manager, one of the most important things is to test our hypothesis in order to assess if the potential product provides a good solution to the problem. Naturally, this would be where I interview the potential users of the product idea to see if we can identify painpoints. In my case, with elementary aged kids, this becomes a lot more finnicky.</p>

         <p>When asking younger kids, "What do you find the most engaging at school?" The common response is, "I don't know." With certain kids you may get dead silence. And if you're lucky, you may get a one-word "friends" response. To get a better idea of the younger kids I work with, I have went ahead and created a user persona of the targeted group (and before you ask, yes, I know toddlers are typically age 3-5): </p>

          <div class="w-50 d-flex justify-content-center mx-auto my-5"><a href="Project Droplets/Todd.png"><img class="img-fluid border" src="Project Droplets/Todd.png" alt="User Persona IMG"></a></div>

          <p>Fortunately for us, while younger students have a harder time conceptualizing and describing their problems, their body language and reactions tell us a substantial amount of what we are looking for. Give them a practice worksheet with nothing but the multiplication problems, you get a response like, "Can we draw?" or "This is boring." Give them something that's interesting, and you'll see their eyes light up and hands moving.</p>

          <p>The easiest way, of course, to test out my hypothesis, would be to   experiment and see how my own students react to the different types of worksheets. By gauging their responses, I can determine if there are any specific product features in worksheets that facilitates learning. To proceed with the experiments, I went ahead and printed out different types of math worksheets packed them into my binder.</p>

          <h5 id="3.2">What did I observe?</h5>
      
          <p>At my different tutoring sessions, I let my students choose between the assortment options of worksheets downloaded off TeachersPayTeachers. While one student simply had no preference, most students picked similar ones. The common trend was that they tend to pick the ones that had images, mysteries or jokes on the worksheet. The least popular one was a straightforward 'bland' worksheet with just the mathematical problems. On average, we were able to get through 2-3 worksheets before the students wanted to do something different. The worksheets that involved solving riddles and coloring were popular as well. However, I found that with certain worksheets, students spent more time on coloring rather than solving the math problems. This was something that I would want to try and avoid.</p>

          <p>It was clear that the math worksheets went beyond just plain ol' problem solving were more effective. And if making worksheets fun help engage students, then there is definitely a market for it. This was a green light for me to proceed with my first MVP. My experiments gave me a rough idea on components of worksheets that students found interesting. Now, it was time to build a MVP comprised of the popular elements to see if I too, can make worksheets "fun". Normally, I would go through the steps of wireframing, mockups then prototypes. But given that this was a one-man project and worksheets not requiring much resources to build, it was fairly low risk to create a prototype.</p>

          <h2 id="4">Product Development</h2>
          <h5>Introducing: Droplets</h5>

          <p>For the product name, I went with Droplets. I am a firm believer in the idea that the knowledge out there is as vast as the ocean. And learning is a lifelong journey. Learning is not instanteous. Each individual drops of water are like the accumulating knowledge. And while small, over time these droplets amount to greatness. Similarly, I want my Droplets to be able to shape another child's learning.</p>

          <h5 id="4.1">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h5>
          <p>The MVP is needed mitigate the risks of creating a large bundles of worksheets that ONLY I thought was fun. For this product, I will be taking the Piecemeal MVP approach. By creating individual worksheets that I can evaluate the users' feedback with, I can determine the Minimum Criteria for Success and see if the product is able to meet it. If the product is valued by users and customers, and the rewards clearly outweigh the costs. In which case, I will be able to continue with the development; producing larger quantities of quality worksheets to bundle together.</p>
          
          <p>Using basic Adobe InDesign and Photoshop skills, I was able to create my first Droplets worksheet:</p>

          <div class="w-50 d-flex justify-content-center mx-auto my-5"><a href="Project Droplets/Worksheet MVP.png"> <img class="img-fluid border" src="Project Droplets/Worksheet MVP.png" alt="Img of Worksheet MVP"></a></div>

          <p>This worksheet is the barebone product with three features I deemed essential. The first feature is the mystery component. I want my users to have something to work towards. The mystery would provide satisfaction when solved. The second component is the visual representation. Pictures have been shown to <a href="https://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00003637/00001">'promote both oral and visual literacy by enticing the young learner to interact with the images and text within the pages'.</a> For the worksheet, the assumption is that the imagery of bacon on the plate would further encourage students to think about the hidden element. The last component is of course, the math problems themselves. There is a sufficient amount of math problems on this worksheet all equally spaced out. 26 problems for 26 letters. Not too many problems to overwhelm the students, and also not too little to make it easy. This is important because there needs to be a balance between work and reward to maximize learning. The only thing left now is to test out our MVP.</p>

          <h5>The results? It's incredible.</h5>

          <p>All my students that I worked with enjoyed the worksheet that I made. Furthermore, when offered the choice between the worksheet above and a competitor worksheet with less features, students chose the worksheet I created. In all my experiments, I did not tell the students that I made the worksheet myself. It was clear that the mystery of the joke had piqued my students' interest. Although, the sarcastic "haha"'s  I got afterwards would indicate that the pun/joke has room for improvement. Two of my students even asked me if I wanted to hear their jokes afterwards. This was a great indictator that students are engaged.</p>

          <p>Going back on the idea of Minimum Criteria of Success, we need to identify the costs behind making this worksheets. One of the things to consider is scalability. Since puzzles can really be done only once before it starts to lose its mystery novelty, it is in some sense, a consumable. This means that we need to look at the cost of not just making one worksheet, but many different worksheets. To create many worksheets, I would need a large source of jokes, images and math problems.</p>
          
          <h5 id="4.2">Scaling the Product</h5>

          <p>It is relatively simple to acquire license-free jokes and images on the internet. If needed, a simple doodle or sketch on Adobe Photoshop should not be too difficult either. For the math side of things, I created a python script (<a href="https://github.com/sunh423/portfolio/tree/main/Project%20Droplets/python%20riddle%20generator">source code</a>) that allowed me to generate random math problems. The script allows for inputs to easily change difficulty and the type of problems it output. For example, I can produce 3 by 3 digit multiplication, or 2 by 2 digit subtraction. These configurations would allow me to create worksheets across different math skill levels. The script ensures that the solutions are unique as well, meaning there won't be more than one alphabet sharing the same solution number. Finally, the script outputs the data as a .csv file (<a href="https://github.com/sunh423/portfolio/blob/main/Project%20Droplets/python%20riddle%20generator/2625a2_add.csv">example</a>) allowing for easy storage and repeated use. Additionally, being a flexible script, this can be potentially utilized for other educational products as well.</p>

          <p>The last step would come down to just filling in the numbers, and blank spaces into the design template I made. Ironically, this part is the most time consuming. One of the things to investigate in the future would be ways to automate the creation process. Off the top of my head,a possible solution would be to create empty fields with Adobe Acrobat and filling in the blanks with csv using another python script. Even then, with different jokes varying in length, a complete automation may not be a flawless solution as we also need to consider styling and placements. For this reason, I will be doing the worksheet assesmbly manually for now.</p>
        
        <h2 id="5">Product Lifecycle</h2>
          <p>One of the key responsibilities of Product Manager is to track, iterate and improve the product according to customers and users' needs. The Product Manager would be responsible for their products throughout its lifecycle and not just in the introduction phase. Going forward, I plan to continue to collect feedbacks from customers and users to help refine the product. Additionally, by using the data provided by TeachersPayTeachers and tracking the competitors' products, I would be able to create data models and metrics via Seaborn as guidelines to help the iteration process. Given that Project: Droplets is its early stage, this section will be reserved for future updates.</p>

          <p>This project is unique in that it is an ongoing case study. As of writing this, I am in the process of producing more worksheets to create a bundle for publish. These worksheets will be free as I want to help work towards making education equitable by making educational assets accessible to everyone. Understandably, a product made free would be received differently as opposed to a paid product. Unlike a corporation setting, this would mean I have the privilege of not having to worry about factors like expensve and profit. Users would less likely to complain since the product is made free as well. This can be detrimental as there may be less feedback to work off of.</p>

        <h2 id="6">Conclusion</h2>
         <p> Overall, this process has been a very rewarding experience. I felt like I was able to utilize all my skills and learn even more throughout this project. For me, this is a starting point, as I can see there are so many ways to continue to improve Droplets. In general, I think the education market is one that has not really been saturated or explored yet. With global pandemic and the increasing utilization of remote learning, accessible quality educational assets will continue to be in demand. In the future, I would also like to explore ways to make learning non-math subjects fun as well.
        <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
          <p>A good product takes so much time and resources. That can be in the form of doing market research, compiling features or constantly improving the product according to market feetback. This project took a lot of time but certainly paid off. Not through money, but through learning. I believe the large time sink is the same reason that there are not fun worksheets in the market. Most teachers are occupied with day to day teaching that few have the time to go this timely process. Even then, a good product often require many skillsets to put together. In my case, I was lucky because all my product's features are creatable with just my skillset. That being said, if I were to continue to expand on the Droplets project going forward, I would definitely be interested in building a team. It would be a pleasure to find teammates with specialized skillsets to make the product more refined. Perhaps this is why all good products generally have a team behind it.</p>
            
          <p class="mb-5">That will also be the next step for me. In recognizing that there are so many aspects to building a product, I am excited to find an organization to help build a product that fits their vision. In the process, I hope to be able to learn from talented people to continue to expand my skills as a Product Manager. Just as much as I want to be able to share these Droplets with the future generation, I too am on the path to accumulating more droplets of knowledge. </p>
