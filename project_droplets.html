          <h5>My Journey into the Product Management World</h5>

            As someone with an interest in contributing to education, I wanted to create a product that both utilized my skills as a Product Manager and was practical. During my days of tutoring and working with students, I have realized that worksheets that tailored to the students' needs are somewhat hard to come by. In my specific case, since I worked with younger students, I wanted worksheets that were interesting and captivating to my students. It's easy to just jot down some math problems for my students to tackle. But at the end of the day, the best type of learning is the one that is both interesting and rewarding.

        <h5>So what does the current education resources market look like?</h5>

        Up at the very top, we have the education giant: Savvas (formerly known as Pearson). Dread it, love it, when it comes to education resources, most school districts partner up with Savvas. Savvas provide: Being the leading education company, Savvas no doubledly follows the standardized curriculum, Common Core, to a T. 

        When it comes to textbooks and exercises, here's where educators tend to have a little bit more freedom. Certain teachers tend to like some textbooks more than others. Whether it's because of examples, images or explanations. Here's where you find companies like IE_1, IE_2, and IE_3. Of which many aim to create complete workbook, worksheets, published resources similar to what Savvas does. The main caveat being a fully flushed out, interactive, online platform that Savvas is able to offer.

        Finally, educators also dig into supplementary resources. This is where specific exercises, lesson plans, and worksheets come in handy. Tutors like myself with little to no funding dig into these resources for hidden gems. Notice how I say "hidden"? As powerful as the Google engine is, most resources offered by different communities are rather scattered. And even after narrowing down the different sites, there's the additional step of navigating through the different worksheets.

        <h5>First experiences with Teachers Pay Teachers</h5>

        TeachersPayTeachers is the "World's most popular online marketplace for original educational resources with more than four million resources available for use today." With both paid and free resources contributed by educators, I was able to get worksheets that I was looking for. Fun, interesting and clearly handmade.

        There's TWO reasons a market like this exists. **First:** Unlike the larger corporations, many of the educators that contribute to Teachers Pay Teachers or publish their own resources elsewhere do so because they are frustrated with the lack of options. Options that students actually want. At the end of the day, many of the curriculum designers at education companies have never been teachers, or, are no longer teaching. **Second:** It is much more affordable. We often forget that with "STATS" a large part of public schools around U.S. are underfunded. For these teachers, if they wanted anything else, they have to find it themselves and possibly pay out of pocket.

        <h5>Experimenting with my students</h5>

        You read that right, wellâ€” sort of. As with any great Product Manager, one of the most important things is assessing the market to see if a product provides a good solution to their problem before fully committing with a product. Typically, this is where I would find the interviewees to have an open conversation about the problem they are facing. In my case, with toddlers, this becomes a lot more finnicky.

        When asking toddlers, "What do you find the most engaging at school?" The common response is, "I don't know." With certain kids you may get dead silence. And if you're lucky, you may get a one-word "Friends." response. 

        Fortunately for us, while toddlers have a harder time putting into words and conceptualizing their enjoyments of school, their body language and reactions tell us a substantial amount of what we are looking for. Give them a practice worksheet with nothing but the multiplication problems, you get a response like, "Can we draw?" or "This is boring." Give them something that's interesting, and you'll see their eyes light up and hands moving. 

        <h5>Droplets - My take on Worksheets</h5>

        Piecemeal Minimum Viable Product (MVP). At the end of the day, I wanted to mitigate the risks of creating a large bundle of worksheets that ONLY I thought was fun. Ultimately, the product is about the customers. Not me. 

        Simple automation python script, I started generating CSV files with unique problems and solutions to fill the grid. 

        I used my inDesign and Photoshop skills to whip up a simple template. 

        Some may ask me why I put in the extra time to put in a cute image. In this specific case, cute image was part of my vision on the engagement component of the worksheet and essential in making the product in mind viable. If the goal was to just create practice problems, I would've opted out of the image.

        Using this formula, I created 3 prototypes for experiment. I gave kids the decision to decide which one of the three they want to do. 

        I set up a validated learning environment to create unbiased choices for students.
