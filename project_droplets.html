          <h5>My Journey into the Product Management World</h5>

           <p> As someone with an interest in contributing to education, I wanted to create a product that both utilized my skills as a Product Manager and was practical. During my days of tutoring and working with students, I have realized that worksheets that tailored to the students' needs are somewhat hard to come by. In my specific case, since I worked with younger students, I needed worksheets that were interesting and captivating to my students. It's easy to just jot down some math problems for my students to tackle. But what use is it if the students are not engaged in the learning? The classes we have all disliked are no doubedtly the ones we found boring or difficult. </p>
            
            <p>Fortunately, learning does not have to be that way. Learning can be made interesting and rewarding. So rather than sitting around and waiting for someone else to make worksheets that my students found interesting. I thought, "Why not do it myself?"</p>

        <h2>Market Research</h2>

          <p>With any good products, the first step is to research the market before jumping in with the idea. If the market is already saturated with what I am looking for, most likely it would be hard to generate success. Likewise, if the market has little potential competitors, it is important to scout out to see what these competitors are doing right and what kind of audience we may be trying to capture with our product idea. That is, if, the product we are trying to create even solves a problem that is worth solving. All of this comes down to market research and roadmapping.</p>

          <p>Up at the very top of private educational assets provider, we have the well-known giant: Savvas (formerly known as Pearson). Dread it or love it, when it comes to education resources, most school districts partner up with Savvas. With much of 2020's education system being reliant on digital platforms due to social distancing, Savvas is becoming more attractive as a choice. Savvas comes from an educational curriculum background where they publish textbooks covering the Common Core curriculum used by public schools. Savvas' main competitors are McGrawHill and Cengage. Both are trying to provide a complete package of K-12 materials encased in a digital platform for teachers and students alike. </p>

          <p>For runners up, we have IXL Learning (based in San Mateo, CA) and DreamBox (based in Bellevue, WA). One thing to be noted is that neither of these two companies provide comprehensive textbooks like Savvas. Both IXL Learning and Dreambox specializes in providing adaptive learning on digital platforms. These two companies have been gaining tractions for last few years here in Washington state. Both platforms provide a "gamified" way for students to learn new materials. From my personal experience working with students, they tend to like learning on these platforms as they make learning a lot more fun. This is something to consider later in my product development phase.
          </p>

          <p>When it comes to textbooks and practice exercises, here's where educators tend to have a little bit more freedom. Certain teachers tend to like some textbooks more than others. Much of this is due to the controversies around Common Core curriculum. Almost all of the teachers and parents I have interviewed with have mentioned that parts of traditional Common Core can be unnecessarily complicated. Luckily, different textbook authors have the liberty of explaining concepts in easier ways. As such, teachers naturally have varied preferences towards the specific textbook materials for their classrooms. A handful of these textbooks are written by teachers, professors and other educators with experiences and credentials. One caveat to these textbooks is that costs can be high either for the schools or families if the class chooses to adopt it. Many underfunded public schools do not have this luxury.</p>

          <h5>Main Competitors</h5>
          <p>At the very end of the list, we have supplementary resources. This is where specific exercises, lesson plans, and worksheets come in handy. Teachers in schools that are underfunded may choose to use whatever textbook resources they are given and then sprinkle in additional supplementary resources to complete the learning experience. Many of these resources are very affodrable (possibly free), and can provide deeper understanding for students in troubled areas. Tutors like myself with little to no funding dig into these resources for hidden gems. Notice how I say "hidden"? As powerful as the Google engine is, most standalone supplementary resources offered by different communities are very scattered. There are of course some sites dedicated to hosting a larger library. For these sites, navigating through the different worksheets can be another challenge.</p>

          <p>Since our primary target audience are shared by the supplementary resources community, I did a more extensive direct and indirect competitor analysis on this <a href="Project Droplets/Market Analysis.xlsx" download>Excel spreadsheet</a>. This worksheet contains my notes and research on the 9+ organizations that host supplementary resources. At a workplace, this would be what I would be presenting when introducing new product idea, and what I would continue to track and revise throughout the product's life cycle.</p>

          <h5>First Experience with TeachersPayTeachers</h5>

          <p>In the realm of supplementary resources, one organization takes on a very different approach. TeachersPayTeachers, as stated on their website, is the "world's most popular online marketplace for original educational resources with more than four million resources available for use today." Essentially, TeachersPayTeachers is both a digital marketplace and library with both paid and free resources contributed by educators. Here's where I typically acquire worksheets that fit the criterias I had in mind. Fun, interesting and clearly handmade.</p>

          <p>There's <strong>two reasons</strong> a market like this exists:</p>

          <p>First, Unlike the larger corporations, many of the educators that contribute to Teachers Pay Teachers or publish their own resources elsewhere do so because they are frustrated with the lack of options. Options that students actually want and like. At the end of the day, many of the curriculum designers at education companies have never been teachers, or, are no longer teaching. </p>
       
          <p>Second, it is much more affordable. At most public schools, teachers have to work with the materials and tools provided by the schools. The financial expenditures are already dictated by school policies. This can be problematic because there is no one-size-fit-all education solution for different students' learning styles. For these teachers, if they want anything else, they would have to acquire it on their own and likely pay out of their own pockets.</p>

          <p>All in all, TeachersPayTeachers is pretty great. Given that this is a solo project, and I also have limited resources, TeachersPayTeachers will be the platform I will be publishing on. Having a pre-existing known platform and potential patrons (teachers, parents and other tutors) will save me time and resources in the scenario where my product completely flops.</p>

        <h2>Roadmapping</h2>
          <h5>Hypothesis & Assumptions</h5>
          <p>In my time using TeachersPayTeachers, I found that quality resources are limited in quantity and the bountiful resources simply did not address my problem as a tutor. Which was, having fun and engaging worksheets to help my students learn effectively. Younger students tend to have shorter attention span and is unable to do traditional worksheets for more than short durations. <em><strong>My hypothesis was that a "fun" worksheet is more effective at engaging younger students, and be able to provide the students with the practices needed to expand on their learning.</strong></em> As with any great Product Manager, one of the most important things is to test our hypothesis in order to assess if the potential product provides a good solution to the problem. Typically, this is where I would find the interviewees to have an open conversation about the problem they are facing. In my case, with elementary aged kids, this becomes a lot more finnicky.</p>

         <p>When asking younger kids, "What do you find the most engaging at school?" The common response is, "I don't know." With certain kids you may get dead silence. And if you're lucky, you may get a one-word "friends" response. To get a better idea of the younger kids I work with, I have went ahead and created a user persona of the audience I am trying to work with (and yes, I know typically toddler is used for age 3-5 year-olds): </p>

          <div class="w-50 d-flex justify-content-center mx-auto my-5"><a href="Project Droplets/Todd.png"><img class="img-fluid border" src="Project Droplets/Todd.png" alt="User Persona IMG"></a></div>

          <p>Fortunately for us, while younger students have a harder time putting into words and conceptualizing their enjoyments of school, their body language and reactions tell us a substantial amount of what we are looking for. Give them a practice worksheet with nothing but the multiplication problems, you get a response like, "Can we draw?" or "This is boring." Give them something that's interesting, and you'll see their eyes light up and hands moving.</p>

          <p>The easiest way, of course, to test out my hypothesis, would be to   experiment and see how my own students react to the different types of worksheets. By gauging their responses, I can determine if there are specific product features in different worksheets that make the respective worksheets effective. To proceed with the experiments, I went ahead printed out different types of math worksheets off TeachersPayTeachers and packed them into my binder.</p>

          <h5>What did I observe?</h5>
      
          <p>At my different tutoring sessions, I let my students choose between the assortment options of worksheets. While one student simply had no preference, most students picked similar ones. The common trend was that they tend to pick the ones that had images, mysteries or jokes on the worksheet. The least popular one was a straightforward 'bland' worksheet with just the mathematical problems. On average, we were able to get through 2-3 worksheets before the students wanted to do something different. The worksheets that involved solving problems and coloring to figure out the hidden pictures were popular as well. However, I found that more time were spent on coloring rather than math work.</p>

          <p>It was clear that when the math worksheets went beyond just mundane problem solving were effective. And if making worksheets fun help engage students, then there is definitely a market for it. This was a green light for me to proceed with my first MVP. My experiments gave me a rough idea on components of worksheets that students found interesting. Now, it was time to build a MVP comprised of the popular elements to see if I too, can make worksheets "fun". Normally, I would go through the steps of wireframing, mockups then prototypes, but given that this was a one-man team and worksheets do not require much resources to build, it was fairly low risk to start building and testing a prototype.</p>

          <h2>Product Development</h2>
          <h5>Introducing: Droplets</h5>

          <p>For the product name, I went with Droplets. I am a firm believer in the idea that the knowledge out there is as vast as the ocean. And learning is a lifelong journey. Learning is not instanteous. Each individual drops of water are like the smaller steps toward the bigger learning. And while small, over time these droplets amount to greatness. Similarly, I want my Droplets to be able to shape another child's learning.</p>

          <h5>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h5>
          <p>The MVP is needed mitigate the risks of creating a large bundle of worksheets that ONLY I thought was fun. For this product, I will be taking the Piecemeal MVP approach. By creating individual worksheets that I can evaluate the users' feedback with, I can determine the Minimum Criteria for Success. If the product is valued by users and customers, and the rewards clearly outweigh the costs, then I will be able to continue with the development.</p>
          
          <p>Using basic Adobe InDesign and Photoshop skills, I was able to create my first Droplets worksheet:</p>

          <div class="w-50 d-flex justify-content-center mx-auto my-5"><a href="Project Droplets/Worksheet MVP.png"> <img class="img-fluid border" src="Project Droplets/Worksheet MVP.png" alt="Img of Worksheet MVP"></a></div>

          <p>This worksheet is the barebone product with three features I deemed essential to make it fun and engaging. The first feature is the mystery component. I want my customers to have something to work towards. The satisfaction from finding the answer to the hidden joke. The second component is the visual representation. Pictures have been shown to <a href="https://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00003637/00001">'promote both oral and visual literacy by enticing the young learner to interact with the images and text within the pages'.</a> For the worksheet, the assumption is that the imagery of bacon on the plate would further anchor the students in the math riddle. The last component is of course, the math problems themselves. There is a sufficient amount of math problems on this worksheet all equally spaced out. Not too many problems to overwhelm the students, and also not too little to make it easy. This is important because there needs to be a reasonable balance of workload and repetition to maximize learning. The only thing left now is to test out our MVP.</p>

          <h5>The results? It's pretty efficient.</h5>

          <p>Simple automation python script, I started generating CSV files with unique problems and solutions to fill the grid.</p>
        
        <h2>Product Lifecycle</h2>
          <p>One of the key responsibilities of Product Manager is to track, iterate and improve the product according to customers and users' needs. Product Manager would be responsible for their products throughout its lifecycle and not just in the introduction phase. Going forward, I plan to continue to collect feedbacks from customers and users to help refine the product. Additionally, by using the data provided by TeachersPayTeachers and tracking competitor's products, I would be able to create data models and metrics via Seaborn as guidelines to help the iteration process. Given that Project: Droplets is its early stage, this section will be reserved for future updates.</p>

          <p>This project is unique in that it is an ongoing case study. As of writing this, I am in the process of producing more worksheets to create a bundle to be made available to the public. Link to the download will be made available here as well. These worksheets will be free as I want to help work towards making education equitable by making educational assets accessible to everyone regardless of financial constraints. Understandably, a product made free would be received differently as opposed to a paid product. This most definitely would have certain implications that I would discuss in the next section.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          
          <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
          <h5>Limitation and Projection</h5>
